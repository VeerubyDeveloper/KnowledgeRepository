  1. First things first, always make sure to clone the branch before you start editing. This ensures that you have a backup of the original code in case anything goes wrong.
  
  2. We understand that sometimes it's easier to follow along with a video reference, which is why we've included one for the branches. This way, you can get a better understanding of what you need to do and how to do it.
  
  3. Additionally, we've attached a unity package for your convenience. This contains all of the necessary files and assets you'll need to get started.
  
  4. Makes sure to push the updates then and there with appropriate description.
