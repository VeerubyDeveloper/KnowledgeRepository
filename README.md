# KnowledgeRepository - Oculus UI

The objective is to add UI elements to the canvas so that they are fully functional and compatible with the Oculus system. This will allow you to interact with the virtual environment using your Oculus headset, making the experience much more immersive.  To add these UI elements, you'll be working with something called a canvas in Unity. Think of a canvas as a blank space where you can place and organize your UI elements, such as buttons, text, and images. 

So, let's get started and make your virtual reality experience a reality!
